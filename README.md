# Proof Snippets Saver (**Under Active Development**)

Easily save proofs of theorems for future use. As we go through massive literature everyday, and with so many results to keep a track of, I always felt that I forgot 
the most important results. Finding and tracking them is super hard.

Here, I am creating a simple utility which is basically an equivalent Proof/Result Snippets Saver. It can do the following:
1. Store original screenshots (Multiple Images supported)
2. Add tags, description and follow on notes
3. Convert and store in pdf and tex format to edit for furture use
4. If there is a lot of interest, I might consider adding support for a mobile application to work with hard-copies of research papers.

community and beyond can make use of it!
